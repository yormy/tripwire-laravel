Donation ware
I only have 24 hours a day, and besides a good night rest I need to eat and work to pay for my morgage. The time left is free time to relax and play
I developed this in my free time, I could have gone swimming, hiking, partying or whatever, but I decided to create this and make this available for you.
Hence I worked for free for you and your company. and that is fine.
However if you have or work in a commpany that has developers than I would higly appreciate a donation.
Ask yourself , could you or your development staff develop this level of tested code and features within 3 hours of their time.
If not, please support me by donating 100 usd for my time and effort.
If you are a sole developer, without employing people or making money with your code, just use this package as you see fit.
But if you make money with it, or save money that you would have otherwise spend on other developers, please donate.

Pro Support
IF you want lifetime pro support, meaning faster merging of your changes/fixes that you submit. access to pre-release versions, vue frontend,
faster response time to your issues. Please consider paying 1000, which is still much less than you would have spent if you hired a team to develop this package
Guiding and support and consulting on how to setup for your software

Maybe vue frontend for sale? / access to git
