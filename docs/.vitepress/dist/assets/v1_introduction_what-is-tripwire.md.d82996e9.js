It is designed to sit in front of every request (or the ones you specify) to listen to what is coming in and determine if that is suspicious or not. Suspicious requests (ie Sqli, xss etc) will be logged with many details about the request for inspection. When the user attempts multiple times the ip/user will be automatically blocked from sending any request and the user will be presented a fuck-off screen.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Features that tripwire include:</p><ul><li>Automatically screen requests and prevent malicious ones</li><li>Automatically temporarily block users due to malicious requests, all site access for this user/ip is blocked</li><li>Increasing the block time when multiple blocks have been registered, until the ip/user is blocked permanent</li><li>Allow a user to remove their blocks on ip/user with a special assigned url. (for developers/security researchers/pentesters)</li><li>Group different types of checkers (<code>wires</code>), for easy usage in middleware groups</li><li>Events dispatching on suspicious requests and on blocks added so you can listen and take additional actions</li><li>Notifications on blocking to email and/or slack</li><li>Extensive configuration on the level of severity (<code>attackScore</code>) of each malicious detection</li><li>Extensive configure how to respond on a malicious detection (silent, exception, abort, view, json, redirect)</li><li>Extensive log functions so you can see exactly what/why/why a certain wire was triggered.</li><li>Debug mode to add mode details to the logs</li><li>Training mode to fully function, register and create blocks, without actually blocking the user. This is useful for initial installation to see if there are false positives</li><li>Determine the specific requests that were made that led to a certain block</li><li>Configure exactly how a block should respond.
