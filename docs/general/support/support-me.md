# Need Support

## I love your feedback
I love feedback from you !
Your feedback in how you use tripwire, features you need, additions or changes in code are highly appreciated.
Both positive and negative feedback is welcome. I am a human being, so yes I also like to hear when you enjoy my work.
* If you **LIKE** Tripwire, please Star it on github and leave a comment on why and how you like it, and tell your friends about Tripwire, write an article about how you used Tripwire or whatever to get the word out
* If you do **NOT LIKE** it, please also let me know and why and what changes you would like to see.

Only with your feedback Tripwire can grow and help more sites to be secure.

Don't be a stranger, reach out and share your thoughts with me

## Pro Support
If you want lifetime pro support, meaning faster merging of your changes/fixes that you submit. access to pre-release versions, vue frontend,
faster response time to your issues. Please consider donating 1000 euro, which is still much less than you would have spent if you hired a team to develop this package.
And if you have questions, sure I am there, and consider I do not have a fully fledged 24/7 support, so responses could take a few hours.
