## Frontend
This package does not contain a frontend for managing blocked states or logged events.
I am currently working on a separate package to function as a frontend

If you really need a frontend either in blade or in vue see the support section

What I have planned for the frontend:
* Blade version
* Vue version
* View all triggered requests
* View all blocked users
* Make a block permanent/ remove permanent flag
* Create a reset-url and send it to someone
* Delete a block
