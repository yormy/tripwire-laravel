# Need Support

## I love your feedback
I love feedback from you !
Your feedback in how you use tripwire, features you need, additions or changes in code are highly appreciated.
Both positive and negative feedback is welcome. I am a human being, so yes I also like to hear when you enjoy my work.
* If you **LIKE** Tripwire, please Star it on github and leave a comment on why and how you like it, and tell your friends about Tripwire, write an article about how you used Tripwire or whatever to get the word out
* If you do **NOT LIKE** it, please also let me know and why and what changes you would like to see.

Only with your feedback Tripwire can grow and help more sites to be secure.

Don't be a stranger, reach out and share your thoughts with me

## Donation
I only have 24 hours a day, and besides a good night rest I need to eat and work to pay for my mortgage. 
The time left is free time to relax and play. A great part of this relax and play time I have spend behind my computer, coding, while I could have been doings something else and enjoying the sun.
Yes, actually at the time of writing this line I am sitting in the shade near a pool, while the sun is beautiful and warm.

Anyway I developed this in my free time, I could have gone swimming, hiking, partying or whatever, but I decided to create this and make this available for you.

***I worked for free for you and your company, and make your software more secure... and that is fine.***

That having said, if you had to employ someone or use one of your developers to create a firewall like this you would have to pay them and it would take them some time to develop. 
So your investment would be considerable to get a system like Tripwire running.

Ask yourself, could you or your development staff develop this level of tested code and features within 4 hours of their time.
If not, please support me by donating 100 Euro (or more) for my time and effort. This will allow me to continue working on this project, support the people I learned from and make it even better for you.

If you are a sole developer, without employing people or making money with your code, just use this package as you see fit, and 'donate' with your feedback and getting the word out
But if you have a paid product/service or if you are paying developers (freelance or a salary), please consider me paying only a fraction of the development costs.

As I said, I am not a company, just a sole developer wanting to make great things, so I could really use your financial support.

## Pro Support
If you want lifetime pro support, meaning faster merging of your changes/fixes that you submit. access to pre-release versions, vue frontend,
faster response time to your issues. Please consider donating 1000 euro, which is still much less than you would have spent if you hired a team to develop this package.
And if you have questions, sure I am there, and consider I do not have a fully fledged 24/7 support, so responses could take a few hours.
